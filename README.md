Scripts for manipulating obf<->mcp<->cb mappings on Minecraft jars

* obf = vanilla Minecraft obfuscation, as in binaries shipped by Mojang
* mcp = descriptive deobfuscation from Minecraft Coder Pack decompilation ("csv" names)
* pkgmcp = same as mcp, but classes are in packages, and includes client and server (used in FML/Forge)
* num = numeric symbol names from MCP, intended for consistency across versions ("srg" names)
* cb = partial deobfuscation from mc-dev/CraftBukkit<1.4.5-R1
* vcb = same as cb, but with versioned package names, used in CraftBukkit>=1.4.5-R1
